		"# Downloading phenotypic data from dbGaP\n",
    "#### 1. Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap and click on \"controlled access data\"\n",
    "![test](Screen1.png)\n",
    "#### 2. Click on Log in to dbGaP\n",
    "![test](Screen2.png)\n",
    "#### 3. Identify yourself with your era common ID and password\n",
    "![test](Screen3.png)\n",
    "#### 4. Click on \"file selector\"\n",
    "This gives you access to the dbGaP file selector where you can find all the files available for the selected project.\n",
    "![test](Screen41.png)\n",
    "#### 5. Filter by study accession\n",
    "Here, we want to get the phenotypic data for the study \"Early onset COPD\", so after checking `Study accession`, we select \"phs000946\".\n",
    "![test](Screen51.png)\n",
    "#### 6. Filter again\n",
    "Since we are only interested in getting the phenotypic data, let's filter by `Content type` and select `phenotype individual-auxiliary` and `phenotype individual-traits`\n",
    "![test](Screen61.png)\n",
    "#### 7. Select the files\n",
    "Click on \"+\" to select all the files\n",
    "![test](Screen72.png)\n",
    "#### 8. Click on \"Cart file\"\n",
    "This will downlaod a .krt file in your download folder\n",
    "![test](Screen81.png)\n",
    "#### 9. Get a PI dbGaP repository key\n",
    "In order to download the files and to decrypt them, you will need a decryption key. This key can be found on a PI dbGaP account, under `Get no password dbGaP repository key`\n",
    "![test](Screen91.png)\n",
    "#### 10. Download and decrypt the files with an R command\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the function `dbgap.download` from the package `sandboxR`, you can directly download the requested files, decrypt them and put them on a \"dbGaP_files\" folder in your working directory."
